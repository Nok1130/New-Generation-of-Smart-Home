# New-Generation-of-Smart-Home (on progress)
The goal of this project is to develop a next-generation smart home system that improves user experience and personalizes the userâ€™s home by integrating Generative AI with the Internet of
Things (IoT). Even while the current smart home technologies are very mature, more individualized interactions that promote a feeling of community are becoming more necessary. This project aims to improve emotional connectedness at the home environment by using generative AI to give tailor-made responses to users.

The project tries to show how the smart home assistant interact with the users and affect the emotional state of users. Also, it demonstrates how generative AI has the potential to revolutionize smart home user experiences as well as explore the future form of smart home.
